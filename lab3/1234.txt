Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Heroes in a half shell. Turtlepower!

There the world's most fearsome fighting team,
they're heroes in a half shell and they're green.
When the evil Shredder attacks,
Those turtle boys don't cut'em no slack.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Splinter taught them to be ninja team,
Leonardo lead's, Donatello does machines.
Raphael is cool but crude,
Raphael: (give me a break)
Michelangelo is aparty dude.
Michelangelo: (party)

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Heroes in a half shell. Turtle power!
